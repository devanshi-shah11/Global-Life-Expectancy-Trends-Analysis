# Global Life Expectancy Trends Analysis

## Objective
The **Global Life Expectancy Trends Analysis** project aimed to evaluate and understand the trends and changes in life expectancy across different countries and years. The goal was to clean a large dataset containing global life expectancy data, identify any data issues, and then conduct an exploratory analysis to identify patterns and trends. The project aimed to assess how life expectancy has evolved over time, particularly from 2007 to 2015, and to provide actionable insights on the factors contributing to life expectancy increases.

The analysis involved two main phases:
1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned by removing duplicate entries and ensuring data integrity. The goal was to ensure that the life expectancy data for each country and year was unique and accurate.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Once the dataset was cleaned, the focus shifted to analyzing the life expectancy trends over time. This involved identifying the changes in life expectancy between 2007 and 2015 for various countries and examining how these trends correlate with global advancements in healthcare, economic conditions, and living standards.

The findings from this analysis will help to identify the factors contributing to life expectancy improvements and provide insights into how countries can continue to improve global health outcomes while addressing challenges such as aging populations.
