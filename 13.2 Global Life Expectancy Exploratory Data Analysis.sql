# Average Life Expectancy by Year - We see an increase in the rate of Life Expectancy

# It benefits economies but challenges aging populations, requiring policies for healthcare, pensions, and workforce sustainability.

# Analysis 3
# Average Life Expectancy VS Average GDP 
# The higher the GDP , better the infrastructure and higher is the Life expectancy and vice versa is true
# This shows us a positive correlation trend 
/* Higher GDP enables better healthcare, nutrition, sanitation, and education,
improving life expectancy. 
Wealthier nations invest in medical research, infrastructure, and social services, 
reducing mortality rates. Conversely, lower GDP limits access to quality healthcare,
 leading to shorter life spans, reinforcing the correlation. */

## ANALYSIS 4: GDP COUNT VS LIFE EXPECTANCY
/*Countries with higher GDP (1326 count) have an average life expectancy of 74.2 years, while lower GDP nations (1612 count) average 64.7 years.
Economic prosperity improves healthcare, sanitation, food security, and social programs, leading to higher longevity.
In contrast, low-GDP nations face healthcare shortages, malnutrition, poor infrastructure, and unstable governance, reducing life expectancy.

#Developed countries have a higher life expectancy (79.2 years) due to better healthcare, 
#while developing nations lag (66.8 years) due to infrastructure and resource limitations.

## Analysis 6: AVG Life Expectancy VS AVG BMI 
## Higher BMI is linked to better nutrition and healthcare access, contributing to increased life expectancy. However, excessive BMI can lead to health risks, 
# impacting longevity despite the overall positive correlation observed.
SELECT Country, ROUND(AVG(Lifeexpectancy),1) AS Life_Exp, ROUND(AVG(BMI),1) AS BMI

## Analysis 7 : This query calculates the rolling total of Adult Mortality for 
#countries with "United" in their name over time.
# The analysis helps track cumulative mortality trends, showing how mortality rates impact life 
#expectancy across years and highlighting healthcare improvements or declines.
SELECT Country, Year, Lifeexpectancy, AdultMortality,

/* Life expectancy and adult mortality are inversely relatedâ€”higher adult mortality lowers life expectancy, while lower mortality improves it.
 Trends help identify healthcare advancements, socioeconomic factors, and public health interventions shaping longevity over time.*/
